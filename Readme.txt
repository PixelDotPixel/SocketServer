Make all    - Builds all the programs needed to run the socket server
Make all    - Run: Builds and runs the program using sockets to send messages back and forth
make close  - Closes all server processes running in the background (Use after make all-Run)
make clean  - Removes all compiled programs.

Instructions on use:
    To try out this program i suggest running "make all-Run" and sending messages back and forth. 

Note:
    The client program can be used on any Unix device as long as it is on the same network (Router/node). I have yet to test it accross different Subnetworks.
